# Deployment

This document will discuss the build and deployment processes of Gideros Player
and your application to iPhone/iPad devices. To follow these steps,
you must be an approved Apple Developer for iOS and install the
iOS SDK (requires Intel-based Mac running Snow Leopard). In the future,
we are planning to wake up our Mac build server to allow developers to
build Gideros Player and your projects for iPhone/iPad remotely on
Windows without having to install the Xcode.

Gideros Player for iOS devices allows you to see and test your application on device
**instantly**. After you deploy and open Gideros Player on your iPhone or iPad,
you see the IP of your device. Enter this IP from "Player→Player Settings" menu:

![Player Settings](images/player_settings.png)

When you press start button, your codes and asset files are transferred to
your iOS device via WiFi and your application starts.

## Deploy Gideros Player to iOS Devices

There are two projects `GiderosiPhonePlayer.zip` and `GiderosiPadPlayer.zip`
comes with the installation. You need to extract these zip files and
open, build, deploy these projects from Xcode.

## Deploy Your Application to iOS Devices

To deploy your application to iPhone/iPad you need to:

1. Export your application as Xcode project
2. Build and deploy Xcode project to actual device

First step is done through "File→Export Project" menu:

![Export Project](images/export_project.png)

For the second step, you need Intel-based Mac running Snow Leopard and
Apple Developer License.

**Note:** Currently, exported Xcode project only includes the libraries for
the real device and not for the simulator.
