<h1>Sprite</h1>
<p>The Sprite class is a basic display list building block: a display list node that can display graphics and can also contain children.</p>
<p>The Sprite class is the base class for all objects that can serve as display object containers on the display list. The display list manages all objects displayed in Gideros. Use the Sprite class to arrange the display objects in the display list. Each Sprite object has its own child list for organizing the z-order of the objects. The z-order is the front-to-back order that determines which object is drawn in front, which is behind, and so on. </p>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<h3>Sprite.new()</h3>
<p>Creates a new Sprite object.</p>
<h3>Sprite:addChild(child)</h3>
<p>Adds a child Sprite instance to this Sprite instance. The child is added to the front (top) of all other children in this Sprite instance. If you add a child object that already has a different display object container as a parent, the object is removed from the child list of the other display object container.</p>
<h3>Sprite:contains(child)</h3>
<p>Determines whether the specified display object is a child of the Sprite instance or the instance itself. The search includes the entire display list including this Sprite instance. Grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on each return <code>true</code>. </p>
<h3>Sprite:removeChild(child)</h3>
<p>Removes the specified child Sprite instance from the child list of the Sprite instance. The parent property of the removed child is set to <code>nil</code>, and the object is garbage collected if no other references to the child exist. The index positions of any display objects above the child in the Sprite are decreased by 1.</p>
<p>The garbage collector reallocates unused memory space. When a variable or object is no longer actively referenced or stored somewhere, the garbage collector sweeps through and wipes out the memory space it used to occupy if no other references to it exist. </p>
<h3>Sprite:globalToLocal(x, y)<br />
</h3>
<p>Converts the x, y coordinates from the global to the display object's (local) coordinates.</p>
<p>The x and y values that you pass to <code>globalToLocal()</code> method represent global coordinates because they relate to the origin (0,0) of the main display area. The method returns x and y values that relate to the origin of the display object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Sound</h1>
<p>The Sound class lets you work with sound in an application.  The Sound class lets you create a new Sound object to load and play an external  WAV or MP3 file.</p>
<p>More detailed control of the sound is performed through the  SoundChannel object for the sound.</p>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<h3>Sound.new(fileName)</h3>
<p>Creates a new Sound object.</p>
<h3>Sound:play(startTime, loops)</h3>
<p>Generates a new SoundChannel object to play back the sound. This method returns a SoundChannel object, which you access to monitor and stop the sound. This method returns <code>nil</code> if you want to play more then one MP3 file or if you run out of available sound channels.</p>
<p>Parameter <code>startTime</code> is the initial position in milliseconds at which playback should start. Parameter <code>loops</code> defines the number of times a sound loops back to the startTime  value before the sound channel stops playback.</p>
<h1>SoundChannel</h1>
<p>The SoundChannel class controls a sound in an application. Every sound is assigned to a sound channel, and the application can have multiple sound channels that are mixed together.</p>
<p><code>Event.SOUND_COMPLETE</code> event is dispatched when a sound has finished playing.</p>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<h3>SoundChannel:getPosition()</h3>
<p>When the sound is playing, this function returns the current point that is being played in the sound file. When the sound is stopped or paused, the function returns the last point that was played in the sound file.</p>
<p>A common use case is to save the value of the position when the sound is stopped. You can resume the sound later by restarting it from that saved position.</p>
<h3>SoundChannel:position()</h3>
<p>This function is equivalent to <code>getPosition()</code>.</p>
<h3>SoundChannel:stop()</h3>
<p>Stops the sound playing in the channel.</p>
