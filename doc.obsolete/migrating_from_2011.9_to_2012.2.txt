# Migrating from v2011.9 to 2012.2

## Obsolete Functions

These 4 functions are moved from `Stage` to `Application` class:

- `Stage:setBackgroundColor`
- `Stage:getBackgroundColor`
- `Stage:setOrientation`
- `Stage:getOrientation`

---

The function `Application:getAccelerometer` is now obsolete because:

- It shouldn't belong to `Application` class at the beginning.
- We introduce a more capable `Accelerometer` class.

---

The functions `Timer.pauseAllTimers` and `Timer.resumeAllTimers` are renamed as `Timer.pauseAll` and `Timer.resumeAll` because:

- From now on, the function pair `pauseAll`/`resumeAll` will be used in many classes like `MovieClip`, `Sound`, `GTween` etc.

**Note:** Currently, these obsolete functions run as before to ensure backward compatibility. But with the next release, these will be removed from documentation. After 1 year, these will be removed from the runtime. Therefore, it's better to alter your code with the new functions.

## gideros.class

`gideros.class` is renamed as `Core.class`. Because the name `gideros` doesn't fit well with the naming rules of our API. Also, with 2012.2, now it's possible to create your base classes and inherit from them:

	A = Core.class()  -- A is a base class
	B = Core.class(A) -- B inherits from A
	C = Core.class(B) -- C inherits from B

**Note:**: `gideros.class` is one the core functions. Therefore, we'll never remove it from the runtime.

## Touch events

When a touch event occurs, `event` table contains two arrays: `touches` and `allTouches`. With 2012.2, we're splitting the touches and instead of the `touches` array, there is a `touch` table contains `x`, `y` and `id` fields. To ensure the backward compatibility, `event` table still contains a `touches` array with only 1 element. If you're using touch events, please use `event.touch` instead of `event.touches`.

## Event.SOUND_COMPLETE

`Event.SOUND_COMPLETE` event is renamed as `Event.COMPLETE`:

	local sound = Sound.new("mysound.wav")
	local soundChannel = sound:play()
	soundChannel:addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onSoundChannelComplete)

**Note:** Currently, both the events `Event.SOUND_COMPLETE` and `Event.COMPLETE` works same for `SoundChannel` objects. `Event.SOUND_COMPLETE` is already removed from the documentation. After 1 year, `Event.SOUND_COMPLETE` will be also removed from the runtime. Therefore, it's better to rename `Event.SOUND_COMPLETE` to `Event.COMPLETE` in your exiting code.

## TileMap:setTile
Previously, to clear a tile 3rd and 4th parameters of `TileMap:setTile` was given as `nil`. Now there is `TileMap:clearTile` function.

**Note:**: There is no backward compatibility here. If 3rd or 4th parameters of `TileMap:setTile` is `nil`, error occurs.
