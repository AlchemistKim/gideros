# File System

In Gideros runtime, there are 3 kinds of directories: **resource**, **document**,
and **temporary**.

### Resource directory
Your code, image, audio and all other files are reside at *resource directory*.
The file and folder structure of your asset library shown below

![Library](images/library.png)

is stored at real device and Gideros Player like:

	{resource directory}/gfx/sprite1.png
	{resource directory}/gfx/sprite2.png
	{resource directory}/gfx/background.png
	{resource directory}/audio/game-music.mp3
	{resource directory}/audio/click.wav
	{resource directory}/data/list.txt
	{resource directory}/main.lua
	{resource directory}/game.lua

Resource directory is the default directory. Therefore, to access the files at resource directory, specify the file path as it is:

	local sprite1 = Texture.new("gfx/sprite1.png")
	local sprite2 = Texture.new("gfx/sprite2.png")
	local background = Texture.new("gfx/background.png")
	local music = Sound.new("audio/game-music.mp3")
	local click = Sound.new("audio/click.wav")

Also, you can use the `io` library provided by Lua:

	io.read("data/list.txt")

You don't need to know the exact path of resource, document and temporary directories because Gideros provides an easy way
to specify files at these directories.

**Note:** Resource directory is *read-only* and you should not try to write any files there.

### Document directory

You can store application created files at *document directory*.
The files created at document directory is permanent between different application sessions. For example,
you can create and then read files at document directory to save player progress.
To specify a file at document directory, append `"|D|"` to the begining of the file name:

	io.write("|D|save.txt")

### Temporary directory

You can create and store temporary files at *temporary directory*.
The files created at temporary directory are not guaranteed to exists between
different application sessions. They may be deleted after your application
session finishes. To specify a file at temporary directory, append `"|T|"` to the begining of the file name:

	io.write("|T|temp.txt")

**Note:** Optionally, you can access the files at resource directory by adding `"|R|"` to the begining of the file name (but you don't need to):

	local sprite1 = Texture.new("|R|gfx/sprite1.png")

To sum up:

	io.read("file.txt")       --> open file.txt at resource directory to read
	io.read("|R|file.txt")    --> open file.txt at resource directory to read (same as above)
	io.read("|D|file.txt")    --> open file.txt at documents directory to read
	io.read("|T|file.txt")    --> open file.txt at temporary directory to read


## Lua Files and Execution Order

Before an Gideros application starts, all Lua files at asset library are executed one by one. It is possible to arrange the
order of execution by setting the code dependencies between Lua files.

If you right click a Lua file and select "Code Dependencies..." from popup menu, "Code Dependencies" dialog opens:

![Code Dependencies fig.1](images/code_dependencies_1.png)

In this menu, you can set the dependencies between Lua files. For example,
if `a.lua` is dependent to `b.lua`, `b.lua` is always executed befure `a.lua`.

If you select "Call Order" tab, you can see the execution order:

![Code Dependencies fig.2](images/code_dependencies_2.png)

**Note:** The file names `main.lua` and `init.lua` have special meaning: When an application starts,
Gideros runtime tries to execute `init.lua` first and `main.lua` last.


## strict.lua

*For the detailed explanation of `strict.lua`, please refer to [http://www.lua.org/pil/14.2.html](http://www.lua.org/pil/14.2.html)*

`strict.lua` checks uses of undeclared global variables. If `strict.lua` is executed, all global
variables must be 'declared' through a regular assignment (even assigning nil will do) in a main
chunk before being used anywhere or assigned to inside a function. Although optional, it is a
good habit to use it when developing Lua code.

To execute `strict.lua` before all other Lua files, simply add `strict.lua` and `init.lua` to
asset library and make `strict.lua` dependent to `init.lua`.

You can download `strict.lua` from [here](assets/strict.lua) that originally comes with the Lua distribution.
