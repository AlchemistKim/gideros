This folder will contain an example winrt project. Eventually Gideros will 
be able to output directories of this sort. 

winrt.cpp is the main program for both the WP8 and Windows store app 
(to be called gideros.Windows.exe and gideros.WindowsPhone.exe). 
These EXEs are to be linked againsted two static libraries gideros.Windows.lib 
and gideros.WindowsPhone.lib (in Visual Studio format) which are in turn generated 
from the standard Gideros library code. 

We need to generate a SLN file with two projects (vcxproj) for Windows
and Windows phone. Both compile winrt.cpp but link against the appropriate
static library. VS can then package and deploy these EXEs along with the users
assets (including LUA files) and eventually upload to the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store.
