<h1>Cloud Saves basics</h1>
<p>Google provides 4 slots, you can access each by keys from 0 to 3.</p>
<p>Each slot provides 128Kb of memory</p>
<p>The good practice is to load the state on app start and update it when needed</p>
<p>There might be cases were there is a conflict between local data and cloud data, this conflict must be solved by developer inside STATE_CONFLICT event by calling googleplay:resolveState and providing resolved data</p>
